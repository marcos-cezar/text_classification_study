### Text Classification Study Case

This is the code of an analysis of a Study case that can be found on Kaggle at [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset).

This script is part of my final paper to get the title of Specialist in Data Science and Analytics course at USPESALQ Institution.

The script applies five algorithms of IA to classify texts in HuffPost platform Nearest Centroid, K-Nearest Neighboors, SVM, Naive Bayes and Neural Network and create a vizualization for the results.
